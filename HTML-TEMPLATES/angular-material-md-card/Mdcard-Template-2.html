                        passed among the peaks of Jotunheimen National Park, I was utterly convinced that there was no more
                        beautiful country anywhere on earth. On my many Norwegian journeys since then, in winter and in summer,
                        I've never lost that feeling. Even more than the fjords and the high country, I now find myself drawn

                        made an instant impact. You must come back in summer, everyone said, so I did, for midnight daytime
                        saunas by impossibly picturesque lakes and melt-in-the-mouth fresh berries and potatoes. Fresh air,
                        the Lapland wilderness, the hiking, the wildlife: it's a natural wonderland within an impressively

                        of their gorgeous country, from its scenic beauty to its edible bounty. My first trips here were
                        to visit my grandparents, and no day was complete without a long walk on the forested trails around
                        their apartments. Dinner was usually local fish and produce from one of Stockholm's market halls
